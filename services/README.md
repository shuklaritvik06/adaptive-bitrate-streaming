## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "serverless-http-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack serverless-http-api-dev (91s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: serverless-http-api-dev-hello (1.6 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [HTTP API (API Gateway V2) event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to:

```json
{ "message": "Go Serverless v4! Your function executed successfully!" }
```

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the `dev` command:

```
serverless dev
```

When you are done developing, don't forget to run `serverless deploy` to deploy the function to the cloud.
